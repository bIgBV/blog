Hi, I am Bhargav Voleti, a Computer Science Master's student studying networks
and distributed systems. When I'm not working on assignments or studying for
mid-terms, I look up guitars I can't afford.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using the awesome [Lanyon]() theme.
* Hosted on Amazon's s3 and served via Cloudfront
* Coded with [Vim](http://vim.org), an amazing code editor

Thanks for reading!
