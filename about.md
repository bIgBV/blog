Hi, I am Bhargav Voleti, a software engineer based in Bangalore, IN working as
a full stack developer in Recruiterbox. I build things for fun and play the
guitar to relax.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using the awesome [Lanyon]() theme.
* Hosted on Amazon's s3 and served via Cloudfront
* Coded with [Vim](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)

Thanks for reading!
