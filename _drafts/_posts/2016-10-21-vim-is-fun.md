I've been using vim since quite sometime now and yet, there is always something new I learn regularly on my time online. Recently I learned of how to sort and format columnar data in Vim.

As programmers you spend a lot of time looking at data and getting information from it. Visual noise in data can be quite a pain in the process of gleaning information from the data. Therefore, 

Write a script in python? Screw that, 2 commands and done

```
:%!column -t
```

```
:%!sort -k3nr
```
